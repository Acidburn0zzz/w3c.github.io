# The W3C organisation

This is the repository for the documentation that sits at 
[http://w3c.github.io/](http://w3c.github.io).

## Editing

If you just wish to edit a document on that site, the simplest thing is to edit one of the `*.src`
files in here and to run `node build.js` which will create the HTML. Do ***not*** edit the `*.html`
files at the root, they are all autogenerated.

If you wish to edit the CSS, or if you wish to make changes extensive enough that rebuilding the
site whenever you make a change (without requiring you to act) is useful, you will need to first
install dependencies:

    npm install -d

To just build the CSS:

    npm run build-css

To just build the HTML:

    npm run build-html

To start the nodemon watcher that rebuilds both automatically:

    npm run watch

## Other files

You will note that some subdirectories have HTML content as well. Those are only there when some
`gh-pages` repositories have moved; they are typically redirects. All the content for the 
documentation is at the root, as `*.src` files (the structure of which ought to be obvious).
